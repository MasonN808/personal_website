# About

I'm **Mason Nakamura**, a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UMass Amherst, working in the College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS) as a member of the <a style="color: rgb(136, 28, 29)"> Resource-Bounded Reasoning Lab</a>, under the guidance of Professor [Shlomo Zilberstein](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/). My research is funded by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) where I broadly work on **planning**, **reinforcement learning**, and **reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)**. More specifically, I'm interested in improving sample-efficiency and performance of value alignment methods for diverse user preferences and enabling agents to continuously learn in non-stationary environments.

Previously, I had internships at the <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/" style="color: rgb(129, 162, 46)">Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI)</a> / <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/" style="color: rgb(1, 49, 98)">Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)</a> (Summer 2023) on building ethically-compliant autonomous systems using constrained deep reinforcement learning, <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/" style="color: rgb(129, 162, 46)"> CHAI</a>/<a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/" style="color: rgb(1, 49, 98)">BAIR</a>  (Summer-Fall 2022) building a formal framework for computationally bounded agents, <a href="https://www.moravian.edu/mathematics/reu" style="color: rgb(44, 70, 147)"> Moravian University</a> (Summer 2021 NSF REU) working on extremal and spectral graph theory, and <a href="https://lbc.msu.edu/about/suriem.html" style="color: rgb(25, 69, 59)"> Michigan State University</a> (Summer 2020 NSF REU) working on geometric deep learning.
