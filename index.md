# About
I'm a senior undergraduate at Marist College, majoring in applied mathematics and data science with a minor in computer science. In Fall 2023, I will start my position as a CS MS/PhD student at UMass Amherst at the Resource-Bounded Reasoning Lab under [Shlomo Zilberstein](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/). Recently, I was a visiting student scholar at the <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/" style="color: rgb(129, 161, 66)">Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI)</a>  at UC Berkeley under [Justin Svegliato](https://justinsvegliato.com/), [Stuart Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell), and [Shlomo Zilberstein](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/). Previously, I was a research intern at Michigan State University and a visiting scholar at Moravian University.

My research interests lie in reinforcement learning, machine learning, and metareasoning. However, in general, I enjoy finding and exploring intersections between mathematics and AI research.

Fun Fact: My Erd&ouml;s number will be 4
