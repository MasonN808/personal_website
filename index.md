# About
I'm a senior undergraduate at Marist College, majoring in applied mathematics and data science with a minor in computer science. Recently, I was a visiting student scholar at the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI) at UC Berkeley under [Justin Svegliato](https://justinsvegliato.com/), [Stuart Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell), and [Shlomo Zilberstein](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/). Previously, I was a research intern at Michigan State University and a visiting scholar at Moravian University.

My research interests lie in reinforcement learning, machine learning, and metareasoning. However, in general, I enjoy finding and exploring intersections between mathematics and AI research.
