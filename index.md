# About

I'm currently a research intern at the <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/" style="color: rgb(129, 162, 46)">Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI)</a> / <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/" style="color: rgb(1, 49, 98)">Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)</a> at UC Berkeley advised by [Stuart Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell) and [Justin Svegliato](https://justinsvegliato.com/) on building ethically-compliant autonomous systems using deep reinforcement learning. In the fall of 2023, I will be a first-year Ph.D. student at UMass Amherst in Computer Science (CICS) in the Resource-Bounded Reasoning Lab advised by [Shlomo Zilberstein](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/). Last summer, I was a visiting scholar at CHAI advised by Stuart Russell, Justin Svegliato, and Shlomo Zilberstein building a formal framework for computationally bounded agents. Prior to this, I was a research intern at Michigan State University working on geometric deep learning and a visiting scholar at Moravian University working on theoretical graph theory.

My research interests lie in reinforcement learning, explainability, AI safety, and applications to robotics.

Fun Fact: My Erd&ouml;s number will be a 4
