# About
I'm a senior undergraduate at Marist College, majoring in Applied Mathematics and Data Science with a minor in Computer Science.  I'm currently a visiting student scholar at the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI) at UC Berkeley under [Dr. Stuart Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell) and the mentorship of [Dr. Justin Svegliato](https://justinsvegliato.com/). Previously, I was a research intern at Michigan State University and a visiting scholar at Moravian University.

My research interests lie in optimization, geometric deep learning, reinforcement learning, metareasoning, AI oversight, and interpretability. However, in general, I enjoy finding and exploring intersections between mathematics and AI research (e.g., dynamical systems and deep neural networks or differential geometry and planning) and do persistantly study mathematics on the side.

On my freetime, I enjoy golfing, hiking, and conversations around anything STEM related.
