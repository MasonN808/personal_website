# About

I'm currently a research intern at the <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/" style="color: rgb(129, 162, 46)">Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI)</a> / <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/" style="color: rgb(1, 49, 98)">Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)</a> at UC Berkeley advised by [Stuart Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell) and [Justin Svegliato](https://justinsvegliato.com/) on building ethically-compliant autonomous systems using deep reinforcement learning. In the fall of 2023, I will be a first-year Ph.D. student at UMass Amherst in Computer Science (CICS) in the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/research/group/resource-bounded-reasoning-lab" style="color: rgb(136, 28, 29)"> Resource-Bounded Reasoning Lab</a> advised by [Shlomo Zilberstein](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/). 

Previously, I had some fun and exciting internships at <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/" style="color: rgb(129, 162, 46)"> CHAI </a> (Summer-Fall 2021) building a formal framework for computationally bounded agents, <a href="https://lbc.msu.edu/about/suriem.html" style="color: rgb(44, 70, 147)"> Moravian University </a> (Summer 2022) working on extremal and spectral graph theory, and <a href="https://lbc.msu.edu/about/suriem.html" style="color: rgb(25, 69, 59)"> Michigan State University </a> (Summer 2020) working on geometric deep learning.

My research interests lie in deep reinforcement learning, constrained reinforcement learning, bounded optimality, AI safety, and applications to robotics.

Fun Fact: My Erd&ouml;s number will be a 4
