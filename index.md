# About
I am a recent graduate of Marist College, majoring in applied mathematics and data science with a minor in computer science. In the summer of 2023, I will be back at UC Berkeley as a research intern at the <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/" style="color: rgb(129, 161, 66)">Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI)</a>. In the fall of 2023, I will be a first year Ph.D. student at UMass Amherst in Computer Science (CICS) in the Resource-Bounded Reasoning Lab advised by Shlomo Zilberstein. Last summer, I was a visiting student scholar at CHAI at UC Berkeley advised by [Justin Svegliato](https://justinsvegliato.com/), [Stuart Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell), and [Shlomo Zilberstein](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/). Prior to this, I was a research intern at Michigan State University working on geometric deep learning and a visiting scholar at Moravian University working on theoretical graph theory.

My research interests lie in reinforcement learning, machine learning, metareasoning, and applications to robotics.

Fun Fact: My Erd&ouml;s number will be 4
